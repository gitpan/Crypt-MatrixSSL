Crypt-MatrixSSL version 1.73
============================

Crypt::MatrixSSL lets you use the MatrixSSL crypto library (see
http://matrixssl.org/) from Perl.  With this module, you will be
able to easily write SSL and TLS client and server programs.

MatrixSSL includes everything you need, all in under 50KB.

You will need a "C" compiler to build this, and it should build on
(at least) Windows, Linux, Unix, and Macintosh machines.

MatrixSSL is an Open Source (GNU Public License) product, and is
also available commercially if you need freedom from GNU rules.

Everything you need should be included here, but check the 
MatrixSSL.org web site to make sure you've got the latest version
of the MatrixSSL "C" code.
